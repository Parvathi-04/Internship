Python Inheritance – Assessment Task
Task 1: Learn Remaining Inheritance Types
Multiple Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance

Also practice implementation of:
Multiple Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance

1. Multiple Inheritance
Definition:
A child class inherits from more than one parent class.
Example:
Copy code
Python
class Father:
    def skills1(self):
        print("Gardening Skills")

class Mother:
    def skills2(self):
        print("Cooking Skills")

class Child(Father, Mother):
    def skills3(self):
        print("Coding Skills")

obj = Child()
obj.skills1()
obj.skills2()
obj.skills3()
Explanation:
Here, Child inherits from both Father and Mother.
So it can access methods of both classes.

2. Multilevel Inheritance
Definition:
A class inherits from another class, and that class inherits from another class.
Example:
Copy code
Python
class Grandfather:
    def house(self):
        print("Owns a house")

class Father(Grandfather):
    def car(self):
        print("Owns a car")

class Son(Father):
    def bike(self):
        print("Owns a bike")

obj = Son()
obj.house()
obj.car()
obj.bike()
Explanation:
Son inherits from Father,
and Father inherits from Grandfather.
So Son can access all methods.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance
Definition:
Multiple child classes inherit from one parent class.
Example:
Copy code
Python
class Parent:
    def property(self):
        print("Parent Property")

class Child1(Parent):
    pass

class Child2(Parent):
    pass

obj1 = Child1()
obj2 = Child2()

obj1.property()
obj2.property()
Explanation:
Both Child1 and Child2 inherit from Parent.

4. Hybrid Inheritance
Definition:
Combination of more than one type of inheritance
(example: multiple + multilevel).
Example:
Copy code
Python
class A:
    def methodA(self):
        print("Class A")

class B(A):
    def methodB(self):
        print("Class B")

class C(A):
    def methodC(self):
        print("Class C")

class D(B, C):
    def methodD(self):
        print("Class D")

obj = D()
obj.methodA()
obj.methodB()
obj.methodC()
obj.methodD()
Explanation:
This example combines:
Hierarchical inheritance (B and C from A)
Multiple inheritance (D from B and C)
So it is called Hybrid Inheritance.
