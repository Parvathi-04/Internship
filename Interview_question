1️⃣ Why should lists be used as instance variables?
Lists are used to store multiple values inside one object.
Example:
If a student has many marks, we store them in a list.
👉 Each object will have its own separate list.

2️⃣ How does Python manage object-specific data?
Python uses instance variables.
Each object stores its own data inside the class using __init__().
So, every object has separate memory for its data.

3️⃣ What problem does Git solve in real projects?
Git solves the problem of:
Tracking code changes
Managing different versions
Avoiding code overwrite
Team collaboration
👉 It keeps full history of the project.

4️⃣ Why do companies prefer GitHub?
Companies prefer GitHub because:
It stores code online (cloud)
Easy team collaboration
Tracks changes
Supports pull requests & code review
Secure and widely used

5️⃣ What is inheritance and why is it important?
Inheritance means one class can use properties of another class.
It is important because:
Code reuse
Less duplication
Easy maintenance
Better structure

6️⃣ Explain any two types of inheritance with real-world examples.
🔹 Single Inheritance
One child inherits from one parent.
Example:
Car inherits from Vehicle.
Car gets engine and wheels from Vehicle.
🔹 Multiple Inheritance
One child inherits from two parents.
Example:
Child inherits qualities from Father and Mother.
